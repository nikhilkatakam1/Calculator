# Getting Started

Contains calculator with enums for Mathematical operations. 
Operation file is the functional interface that contains the applies the math operation to entrants. 
API has been provided for chaining and also for performing individual mathematical operations. 

ExecuteOperation: 
Main class demonstrates how the operators can be setup and also chaining for various operators. 
Initially, 2 operands are picked for performing addition to get started and then chaining is demonstrated to perform sequential operations like subtraction, multiplication and division.
In the event of a division operation, an arithmetic exception is fired to ensure divide by 0 is handled smoothly
